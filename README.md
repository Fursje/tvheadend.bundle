HTS-TVHeadend channel for Plex Media Server

WIP
What does it do for now?
It supports direct stream from TVheadend from a dreictly taken stream : example http://user:password@server:port/stream/channelid/number
Preferences for username password port and host is there and working.
It only works in PHT och PLEX Media Client on OSX Win Linux for now.
Reads the channel names and id numbers for that channel out of channels.xml (Thought is to write something that reads out the channels from tvheadend to this file).

Things to do in no order:
Auto import and list channels from tvheadend

Options for using TVHeadend as a transcoder so iOS/mobile devices can use the plugin.
New icon and banner (This on is just a random line with some filters made in Gimp for my first project)

Things that I want to do but how no clue how to achive.
EPG
Recording options
