HTS-TVHeadend channel for Plex Media Server

WIP
What does it do for now?
It supports direct stream from TVheadend from a dreictly taken stream : example http://user:password@server:port/stream/channelid/number
Preferences for username password port and host is there and working.
It only works in PHT och PLEX Media Client on OSX Win Linux for now.

Things to do in no order:
Auto import and list channels from tvheadend
Options for using TVHeadend as a transcoder by using TVH transcoding branch (https://github.com/john-tornblom/tvheadend)
New icon and banner (This on is just a random line with some filters made in Gimp for my first project)

Things that I want to do but how no clue how to acchive.
EPG
Transcode streams using PMS so iOS/mobile devices can handle the streams.
Recording options
